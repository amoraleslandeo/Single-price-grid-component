## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I learned to use the SASS language for CSS. This allows me to structure the tags and their properties in the same way as HTML. The advantages of this language are the similarity with HTML and also the lightness of the final file, which allows the code uploaded to the browser to be processed much faster.
